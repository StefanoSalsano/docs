Introduction to HIKe - eCLAT
============================

**HIKe** and **eCLAT** are an **open source** software framework for eBPF programming (in Linux networking). 


HIKe
----

HIKe stands for "Heal, Improve and desKill eBPF". It offers a Virtual Machine abstraction (the *HIKe VM*), which facilitates the *composition* of eBPF programs using a programmatic approach.


eCLAT
-----

eCLAT (eBPF Chains Language And Toolset) is a high level language and programming framework. A developer can write eCLAT scripts in a python-like language to compose HIKe eBPF programs, with no need of understanding the complex details of regular eBPF programming.
